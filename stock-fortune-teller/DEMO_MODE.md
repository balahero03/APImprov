# Demo Mode - Stock Fortune Teller

## Overview
The Stock Fortune Teller application now includes a robust demo mode that ensures all features work even when the Alpha Vantage API is unavailable or rate-limited.

## Features in Demo Mode

### âœ… What Works
- **All UI Components**: Charts, dashboard, trading interface

2. **User Notification**: A warning notification appears when demo mode is active
3. **Visual Indicator**: A "Demo Mode" badge shows in the interface
4. **Seamless Experience**: All features work identically with mock data

- **Realistic Testing**: Developers can test all features without API limits
- **User Education**: Users can explore the platform without real money
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection (after initial load)

## Technical Implementation

- **Graceful Degradation**: API errors are caught and handled elegantly
- **Data Consistency**: Mock data follows the same structure as real API data
- **Performance**: Mock data loads instantly (no network delays)
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more stocks or modify data patterns

## Getting Started

1. Run the application: `npm run dev`
2. Enter any stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL)
3. If API is unavailable, you'll see the demo mode notification
4. All features work normally with realistic sample data

## Customization

To modify mock data or add new stocks, edit the `generateMockData` function in `src/services/alphaVantage.js`.
